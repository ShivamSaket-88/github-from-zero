# Day 4 – GitHub Issues

## What is an Issue?
An issue is used to track a task, bug, or improvement in a repository.

## Why are issues important?
- Help plan work before starting
- Track progress clearly
- Improve communication in a team

## When should you create an issue?
- Before starting a new task
- When you find a bug
- When suggesting an improvement

## Where do issues live?
Issues are created inside a repository under the "Issues" tab.

## Issue lifecycle
1. Issue is created (Open)
2. Work is done related to the issue
3. Issue is closed after completion

## Key learning from Day 4
- Every task can be tracked as an issue
- Closing an issue means the work is completed
- Issues remain visible even after closing
