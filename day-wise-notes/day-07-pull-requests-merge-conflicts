# 📅 Day 7 — Pull Requests & Merge Conflicts

This day focuses on how real teams collaborate on GitHub using
branches, pull requests, reviews, and conflict resolution.

---

## 🔁 What is a Pull Request?

A Pull Request (PR) is used to request merging changes from one branch
into another (usually `main`).

It allows:
- Code review
- Discussion
- Safe collaboration
- Quality control

---

## 🌿 Branch-based Workflow

Steps followed:
1. Created a new branch from `main`
2. Made changes in the branch
3. Committed changes
4. Opened a Pull Request
5. Reviewed and merged it

---

## ⚠️ What is a Merge Conflict?

A merge conflict occurs when:
- Same file
- Same line
- Modified differently in two branches

GitHub cannot decide automatically.

---

## 🛠 How Merge Conflicts are Resolved

- Compare both changes
- Keep the correct one
- Remove conflict markers
- Mark as resolved
- Commit the merge

---

## ✅ Learning Outcome
