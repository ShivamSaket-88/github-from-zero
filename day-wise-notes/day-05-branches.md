# Day 5 – GitHub Branches

## What is a Branch?
A branch is a separate line of development in a repository.
It allows you to work on new features without affecting the main code.

## Why are branches important?
- Keep the main branch stable
- Allow multiple people to work in parallel
- Reduce the risk of breaking code

## What is the main branch?
The main branch (often called `main`) contains the stable and working version of the project.

## When should you create a new branch?
- When starting a new feature
- When fixing a bug
- When experimenting with changes

## Basic branching rule
Never make major changes directly on the main branch.
Always create a new branch for work.

## Key learning from Day 5
- Branches help in safe development
- Each task should have its own branch
- Main branch should stay clean and stable
