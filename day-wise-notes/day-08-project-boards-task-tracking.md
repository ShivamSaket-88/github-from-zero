# 📅 Day 8 — GitHub Project Boards & Task Tracking

On Day 8, we learn how **real-world teams manage and track work on GitHub**.
This includes using **Projects, Issues, and Pull Requests together** to
organize tasks, assign responsibilities, and monitor progress.

This concept is **extremely important** for:
- College group projects
- Internships
- Industry-level software development

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By the end of this day, you will understand:
- What task tracking means in software projects
- What GitHub Projects are and why they are used
- How Issues and Pull Requests connect with Projects
- How teams track work efficiently on GitHub

---

## 🔍 What is Task Tracking?
Task tracking is the process of:
- Breaking a project into smaller tasks
- Assigning tasks to team members
- Tracking progress of each task
- Ensuring work is completed on time

Without task tracking, team projects become disorganized and confusing.

---

## 🧩 What are GitHub Projects?
GitHub Projects is a **visual task management tool** provided by GitHub.
It works like a kanban board (similar to Trello or Jira).

GitHub Projects help you:
- Track Issues and Pull Requests
- Organize tasks visually
- Manage collaboration in teams
- See the overall progress of a project

---

## 🗂️ Common Project Board Columns
Most project boards use the following columns:

- 📝 **Todo**  
  Tasks that are planned but not started yet

- 🚧 **In Progress**  
  Tasks that someone is currently working on

- 🔍 **Review**  
  Tasks waiting for review or feedback

- ✅ **Done**  
  Tasks that are completed successfully

You can add, remove, or rename columns based on project needs.

## 🛠️ How to Create a GitHub Project (UI Steps)

1. Open your repository on GitHub
2. Click on the **Projects** tab
3. Click **New Project**
4. Choose **Board** as the project type
5. Give your project a meaningful name
6. 
   Example:

   Your project board is now ready to use.

---

## 🔗 Linking Issues with Project Boards
Issues are the backbone of task tracking.

### Steps to link an Issue to a Project:
1. Create a new Issue
2. Open the Issue
3. Look at the right sidebar
4. Click on **Projects**
5. Select your project board

The Issue will now appear as a task card on the board.

## 👥 Real Team Workflow Example
Consider a team of three students working on a college project:

- **Shivam** → Documentation  
- **Rishi** → Frontend Development  
- **Adarsh** → Database & Backend  

Workflow:
- Each task is created as a separate Issue
- Issues are assigned to team members
- Issues are added to the Project board
- Cards are moved across columns as work progresses
- Issues are closed when tasks are completed

This is exactly how professional software teams work.

---

## 🧠 Best Practices for Using GitHub Projects
- Create one Issue for one task
- Assign every Issue to someone
- Keep Project boards updated
- Close Issues once work is done
- Use clear titles and descriptions

---

## 🏆 Why This Matters for Your GitHub Profile
Using GitHub Projects shows that:
- You understand team collaboration
- You can manage real-world workflows
- You are familiar with industry practices

Recruiters and mentors value this a lot.

---

## 📌 Summary
- Task tracking is essential for team projects
- GitHub Projects provide a visual workflow
- Issues and Pull Requests integrate with Projects
- This skill is crucial for internships and jobs
