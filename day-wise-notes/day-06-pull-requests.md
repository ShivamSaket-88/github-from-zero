# Day 6 – GitHub Pull Requests

## What is a Pull Request (PR)?
A pull request is a request to merge changes from one branch into another,
usually from a feature branch into the main branch.

## Why are pull requests important?
- Allow code review before merging
- Prevent breaking the main branch
- Enable team collaboration

## When should you create a pull request?
- After completing work on a feature branch
- After fixing a bug
- After updating documentation

## Basic Pull Request workflow
1. Create a new branch
2. Make changes and commit them
3. Open a pull request
4. Review changes
5. Merge the pull request

## What happens after merging?
- Changes are added to the main branch
- Related issues can be closed automatically
- Project history remains clean

## Key learning from Day 6
- Never push major changes directly to main
- Pull requests improve code quality
- PRs are essential for teamwork
